# sk-phenomena-recording-portal
Full Source Code for A Phenomena Recording System.

## DESCRIPTION
This is a completely free source code (including database structure) for "Phenomena Recording System", a webapp I developed using Yii2 Framework, MySQL Database, and AdminLTE3. The app consists of the Indonesian Language as my first language. But overall, it's easy to use since the code is mostly English. 

The features this app has are as follows:
1. Phenomenon input (such as online news or printed newspaper, recorded to the database)
2. Phenomena categorization (manual) into 24 categories
3. Dashboard, snapshots on the database
4. Monitoring, descriptive analysis of users' activity in phenomena management
5. Dynamic tabulation for phenomena, aggregately or separately
6. User management
7. News crawling using Google CSE API and News API

### The original version of this app was the main study for my research [here](https://ajstd.org/index.php/ajstd/article/view/680) and [here](https://jurnal.kominfo.go.id/index.php/pekommas/article/view/2040105).

## HOW TO ENJOY
Before using this code, you gotta make sure you have your local server ready (such xampp or wamp), IDE (I use VSCode), git and composer installed on your computer.

1. Open your terminal in ```htdocs``` (if you use xampp) or ```www``` (if you use wamp)
2. Run this code to clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/khansasafira19/sk-phenomena-recording-portal.git```
3. Access the folder using ```cd sk-phenomena-recording-portal```, still in your terminal
4. Run ```composer update``` to make everything run on the app (it is to fill up the vendor folder)
5. Access your phpmyadmin, create a database, and name it "sk_prs" or whatever you like. Then import the .sql file in ```root\sql``` folder.
6. Make changes to the ```config\db.php``` file on the database connection, according to your setup.
7. That's it, the app should run now. Access it on http://localhost/sk-phenomena-recording-portal/ using username ```admin``` and password ```admins```
